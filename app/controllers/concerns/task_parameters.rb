    # The task_params might contain incomplete attributes for files, which we must fix before using the parameters.
    # Those file attributes can be attached directly to the task, to any of test or to any model solution.
    # For each of the potential file attributes, we must check if the attachment attribute should present and re-add it if missing.
    # This behavior is needed, since SimpleForm does not keep the (empty) attachment attribute if no file got attached by the user.
    # Otherwise, an old file version would be linked to the task, test or model solution after a failed model validation.
