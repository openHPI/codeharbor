# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        header: About autograders and account links
        paragraph_html: |
          <h3>About account links:</h3>
          <p>
            Account links define a connection to an autograder. <br/>
            If you have an account link you can simply export exercises available to you into the autograder. <br/>
            You can create your own account link if you have the push_url of an autograder that can handle OAuth2 post requests.</br>
          </p>
          <h3>You want to connect an autograder that already has OAuth2 and ProFormA-XML support:</h3>
          <p>
            If the autograder can import exercises sent via OAuth2 request in the ProFormA-XML format you will need the following things: <br/>
            1. Push-url: The autograder needs to have an ULR codeharbor can post the exercise to. <br/>
            2. OAuth2-token: The autograder must be able to link a token to your account to authorize exercises that will be pushed there. <br/>
               If you do not need a specific token you can generate a token when creating an account link on codeharbor side or use whatever you want <br/>
               as long as it is the same token on codeharbor and the autograders side.<br>
            You also have to create a client-id and client-secret for an account link on codeharbor side. <br/>
            If the autograder does not require a specific one you can auto-generate them.<br/>
          </p>
          <h3>How to prepare your own autograder:</h3>
          <p>
            CodeHarbor uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol to send exercises via a post request. <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">https://oauth.net/2/</a><br/>
            CodeHarbor is the client in this case, your autograder the resource server and you are the resource owner.
            When you are exporting an exercise, codeharbor first generates an XML-file complying with the ProFormA-XML standard for exchanging exercises. <a href="https://github.com/ProFormA/taskxml">https://github.com/ProFormA/taskxml</a>
            Then it will make a post request to the URL you chose as the push_url. The XML-file will be in the request body and the OAuth2 token in the request headers ("request.headers['Authorization']"). <br/>
            In your autograder you need to make sure that the OAuth2 token is validated and the corresponding user found. We recommend to add an interface for users to add an OAuth2-token. <br/>
            The XML-file in the request-body needs to be parsed into the database. Since we are using the ProFormA-XML format you can parse the xml using xpath. <br/>
            Finally, please respond with a 200 status code if everything went okay or a 400 if it did not. <br/>
          </p>

        Account links define a connection to an autograder. <br/>
        If you have an account link you can simply export exercises available to you into the autograder. <br/>
        You can create your own account link if you have the push_url of an autograder that can handle OAuth2 post requests.</br>
        For more information on how to establish a connection to an autograder please click the following link:</br>

      info:
        push_url: |
          The address on the autograder side your exercise can be exported to. If you don't know what to write here, ask the autograders admins.
        check_uuid_url: |
          The address on the autograder side that can be queried to determine if the exercise already exists.
        name: |
          Can be anything to Identify your account link.
        token: |
          Will be used to authenticate your export request. Has to be the same on both sides.
