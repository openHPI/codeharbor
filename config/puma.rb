# Puma can serve each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
# The `threads` method setting takes two numbers: a minimum and maximum.
# Any libraries that use thread pools should be configured to match
# the maximum value specified for Puma. Default is set to 5 threads for minimum
# and maximum; this matches the default thread size of Active Record.

# Specifies the `worker_timeout` threshold that Puma will use to wait before
# terminating a worker in development environments.
worker_timeout 3600 if ENV.fetch('RAILS_ENV', 'development') == 'development'

# Specifies the `port` that Puma will listen on to receive requests; default is 7500.

# Specifies the `environment` that Puma will run in.

# Allow puma to be restarted by `bin/rails restart` command.

# Fork all workers from worker 0 to reduce memory footprint and allow phased restarts.
# For successful phased restarts, we need at least 3 workers (see doc).
# See https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/fork_worker.md.
# Passing `0` will disable automatic reforking, which currently breaks with SdNotify.
# See https://github.com/puma/puma/issues/3273.
fork_worker 0

# Disable explicit preloading of our app.
# With `fork_worker`, we will have an implicit preloading.

# Specifies the output redirection that Puma will use.
# Params: stdout, stderr, append?

# TODO: Consider `on_booted` as well, which currently breaks with Pumactl.

# Note on Phased Restarts:
# - Phased Restarts are only supported in cluster mode with multiple workers (i.e., not in development).
# - The Puma binary won't be upgraded on phased restarts, but since we have the unattended-upgrades, this is not a major issue.
# - See https://github.com/casperisfine/puma/blob/master/docs/restart.md.
